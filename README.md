Hi, Iâ€™m married, a father, Brazilian and an avid runner. I have a Master degree in Computer Science and I've been programming since 1997. I work as Innovation Manager at OceanPact and I haven't had the time to code as much as I used to. My focus today is to harness the best available technology to improve the safety or lower the costs of our operations, as well as provide innovative high technology services to our clients.
